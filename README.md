As part of this project, I performed a comprehensive exploration of performance testing on the [OpenCart platform](opencart.abstracta.us).\
The project features a variety of scenarios, including:
- 📋 End-To-End scenarios:
  - 🛍️ Covering registration and the 1st purchase scenario from beginning to end using the JMeter Script Recorder.
  - 🛍️ Covering login and the 2nd purchase scenario from beginning to end using the JMeter Script Recorder.
  - ⚙️ Featuring essential Assertions, Logic Controllers, Listeners, and Regular Expression Extractors, for handling dynamic variables, and improving the accuracy of the outcomes.
- 📈 Load, Stress, Spike, and Endurance Testing for examining the platform's responsiveness and stability under varying loads.
- 🆗 API Performance Testing.
- 📂 FTP Server Performance Testing.
- 🗄️ SQL Server Local Database Performance Testing Using JDBC Connection.
- 🗄️ MySQL Online Database Performance Testing using [db4free.net/phpMyAdmin](db4free.net/phpMyAdmin) through JDBC Connection.
- 📧 Email Server Performance Testing using SMTP Connection.
- 📊 Performing Tests and Producing Reports in both CSV and HTML formats using:
  - 💠 Non-GUI Mode (CMD).
  - 💠 JMeter GUI Mode.
